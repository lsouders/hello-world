# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first repository on github.  I plan to use this to host projects for anyone to look at or use.
I consider myself to be moderately experienced in programming with my strengths in Java and C++.  I am also
teaching myself html, css, and javascript to develop frontend webpages.
